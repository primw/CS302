##CS 302 - HOMEWORK 3

#How To Use
The source code will test Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, and Merge Sort 10x on three different sample sizes and will do this twice for an unsorted input as well as a sorted input. All the text files with the naming `${size}$(typeOfSort}.txt` are the output files that contain the data after it has been sorted.

In the Deliverables directory, there are folders that contain the statistics of each sort indivdually. If you want to see all the averages including graphs, they will be in the `CS302 - Homework3.pdf`
